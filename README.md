# 🧭 Data Engineering Roadmap

Hi, I'm **Al-Husseini Rayan** 👋  
This repository documents my journey to becoming a **Data Engineer**, from fundamentals to advanced pipeline design and cloud architecture.

---

## 📚 Overview
This roadmap follows a structured, project-based learning approach — building from core programming to real-world data engineering projects.

### 🗓️ Learning Phases
1. **Foundations** – Python, Linux, Git  
2. **Data Manipulation** – SQL, Pandas, Power BI  
3. **Data Pipelines** – ETL, Airflow, Spark  
4. **Data Warehousing** – Modeling, Redshift, BigQuery, Snowflake  
5. **Cloud Engineering** – AWS, GCP, Azure
